HTML-Navigation-and-Linking
HTML Links
The A element, or anchor, is used when we want to create a link. We must add a href attribute with a URL enclosed in quotes in order to accomplish this. The link will take us to this URL. Hypertext Reference is what the term "href" (a throwback acronym) stands for. To make text or images clickable, we can place them in between the opening and closing A tags. For instance, we can make the sentence "this is a link" into a real link that, when clicked, directs us to example.com.

Links, however, are not just for text; we can also encircle images or even more intricate components, such as teaser cards. This enables us to put together a collection of connected parts.

Though it's been common practice to use the straightforward HTTPS://example.com, URLs can be much more flexible. You can use the full URL when pointing to a particular web page or another website. Whether or not it has a trailing slash is irrelevant. Because these URLs point to a specific place on the internet, they are known as absolute URLs. Hypertext Transport Protocol, or HTTP or HTTPS, needs to be included in an absolute URL. This protocol is essential for linking because it establishes the guidelines for online communication.

The distinction between HTTP and HTTPS may be of interest to you. Secure is represented by the "S" in HTTPS. While HTTP used to be the first letter of every web address, experts now advise using HTTPS for increased security. Modern browsers automatically add the HTTPS:// prefix when you type example.com. 

HTML URL Pathways
Absolute URLs are merely one choice for creating links. Relative URLs can be used in place of absolute URLs when linking to content located on the same website and domain as the page that contains the link. Suppose you are developing Awesome Dogs, a website that will eventually be available at http://www.awesomedogs.com. On your computer, though, you are working on a local copy of the website and adding a menu bar. Afterwards, for testing and review purposes, there will be duplicates of the website hosted on various servers with distinct URLs.

All of the links should point to the local copy of the files when working locally, and they should point to the pages and files on the testing server when a copy of the website is hosted there. In order to accomplish this, the http://www.awesomedogs.com portion of the URL must be removed while preserving the ability for the browser to find the files.

Not only can creating a relative URL be helpful for the A element (linking), but it can also be used to reference any other file that has its path specified, such as CSS, JavaScript, image, or video files. 

To create a URL from scratch, you must first understand the file system. Envision several files that are neatly organized into various directories or folders. To create a link to a March 9 blog post, tell the browser to search inside the "blog" folder and find the "March-9.html" folder. Now, folder names just have names like "blog" or "people" without any extension, but filenames have extensions like.html,.jpg,.css, and.js. A URL with slashes in it suggests that we should dig a little further or descend a level. 

You can create a relative URL by adding the first slash at the beginning but leaving out the domain name. This instructs the browser to begin at the outermost top level, or root level, of the file structure. As an alternative, we can write the path relative to the file that contains the link.

One thing to keep in mind is that both versions of a URL will direct you to the same location, regardless of whether a trailing slash is present.

Assume that the CSS directory contains a file named styles.css. Suppose we would like to add a link to the logo.gif file, which is housed in the images folder, from our CSS file. There are two ways we can write the URL: 

/images/logo.gif 
../images/logo.gif
The URL generated by the original version, /images/logo.gif, is relative to the root level. This indicates that the file will be found by the browser from the website's root. The second version, however, which is located at../images/logo.gif, generates a URL that is relative to the file location in which the URL is written. A slash and ".." indicate that you are moving up one level in the directory structure.

It is important to think about how your URLs affect search engine rankings and user experience. Write URLs with care, just like you would any other kind of content. When working on a project that switches between servers, using relative URLs can be very useful.

Navigation
Imagine we want to make a main menu bar for our website. We have four links: home, people, prices, and contact. To generate a list of links, each link is encased in an element that has the appropriate URL and is then wrapped in a "li" element. The entire list should be enclosed in a "ul" element, which stands for an unordered list, in order to preserve order. Lastly, use a "nav" element to encapsulate the entire menu and designate it as the site's navigation.

Use CSS styling to give the menu a look. It looks like a simple list without styling, but we also want screen readers and assistive devices to recognize it as the main menu. Now include a few characteristics to explain its goal. Assign the "navigation" role to the "nav" element, indicating that it is the page's main navigation. Furthermore, add a descriptive label to the main menu that can be read aloud by a screen reader by adding a "aria label". Recall that there are other methods for appropriately marking up a main navigation menu besides this one. Depending on the circumstance, a number of strategies are equally effective. 

This brings us to another kind of menu: the breadcrumb trail. As with the main menu, enclose the breadcrumb links in a "nav" element; however, since the links' order is important, use an ordered list ("ol"). Assigning the role "navigation" to this menu is not appropriate; instead, we have added the "aria label" of "breadcrumb" to give context for reading aloud.

Concentrate on the links that are normally located in a page's footer. The navigation on this website does not include these links. Just include links in a "footer" element and mark each one as a link on its own. Here, an unordered list or "nav" element are not required. It's just two sentences with a link to more content, presented simply.
